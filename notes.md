# Intro to JavaScript:

Declaraing the variable:  
 var x=10  
Finding the type of variable:  
 typeOf(x)

```Js
var student = {
  name:"ashi"
  age:20
  company:"proclink"
}

typeOf(name)=> typeOf(student.name)

```

data type of array : 'object'[beacause of key value pair]  
typeOf(Infinty): 'number'  
typeOf(-Infinty): 'number'

when u declare the variable but when u don't give the value then we get undefined

Undefined is a type and it's value is also undifined  
typeOf(null): 'object'

The js code is written within the <script></script>  
It must be written before </body>

Types of variable declarations:

var :  
 Reassign and redeclare is possible,  
 let:  
 reassign is possible and redeclare is not possible ,  
 const:  
 reassign and redeclare not possible
